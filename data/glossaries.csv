atheism,Atheism,"Atheism, from the Greek ·ºÑŒ∏ŒµŒøœÇ (atheos), literally means ""without gods,"" referring to those who rejected the existence of the Greek pantheon. In modern context, atheism can represent several different viewpoints, but is most commonly conceived of as a lack of belief in gods. A person can be both atheist and religious, provided that he or she believes in a religion that does not have any deities, such as some forms of Buddhism. The word ""atheism"" is not a proper noun (we do not worship the All Powerful Atheismo), so there is no need to capitalize it except in special cases such as the beginning of a sentence."
atheism,agnosticism,"An agnostic is someone who claims they don't know (""weak agnosticism"") or it is not possible to know (""strong agnosticism"") for certain whether or not gods exist. The term Agnosticism comes from Greek: a (without) + gnosis (knowledge)."
atheism,Anti-theism ,"The active or inactive attempts to put an end to theism, often as a reaction to anti-scientific thought, bigotry, and questionable morals propagated by many theists. Many self-identified vocal atheists are in fact anti-theists on some level. There are a few reasons for this, perhaps most significantly the fact that anti-theists tend to have a lot more to say. Make no mistake: there are a lot of atheists who are not openly hostile to religion. The squeaky wheel, however, tends to get the grease, and atheists who have no major gripes with religious belief have less motivation to speak out. The most public example of an atheist who is not an anti-theist is S.E. Cupp (though many are skeptical of her atheism). One of the better examples of an anti-theist is Christopher Hitchens."
atheism,State Atheism,"This is the ""theocratic"" form of atheism. It is the ideology that atheism should be enforced by the government, as it has been under many communist governments. Most members of r/atheism are secularists and oppose this notion. Under current and historic Communist governments, the primary desire of the state is economic and social reconfiguration of society, and religious attitudes are an outgrowth of those larger objectives."
atheism,Secularism,"Secularism refers to the government not respecting any religion or religious beliefs. In this way it does not promote any form of theism or atheism. An example being that government recognized ""Day of Prayer"" is not secular, nor would a government recognized ""Day of Disbelief in Deities"" be."
atheism,Deism,"Deists believe that a higher power created the universe long ago but is not or no longer actively present in the world and does not intervene in its affairs. Because of their belief in this ""higher power,"" often thought of as a god, they don't qualify for the ""atheist"" label. Some definitions consider Deism to a subset of Theism, while others consider the two terms to be distinct- there are occasional minor squabbles about this, but the consensus in /r/atheism seems to be that the former is correct. However, for practical purposes there is little difference between a deist and an atheist: Most deists do not engage in the usual religious practices of praying, worshiping, rituals, restrictions in diet and/or lifestyle or regarding a central holy doctrine. Deists share the atheist belief that there is no deity active today. Because of this similarity, some atheists will claim deism when asked about their religion. Deism places no practical obligations on its adherents, yet does not bear the heavy public stigma associated with atheism. Americans can benefit from the respect afforded many well-known Deists among the nation's fathers: Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, Thomas Paine, James Madison, George Washington. Because the deist God takes no action in the present universe, its existence is effectively meaningless because no special actions are the result of its existence. That is to say, there's effectively no difference between a godless universe and one with a Deistic god, so asserting one's existence is like asserting the existence of an Invisible Dragon in your Garage."
atheism,Theological Noncognitivism,"Do you believe that frajingle majibbity jibbity moop? Why or why not? If your answer is ""How am I supposed to believe in that? It's a nonsense statement!"", you're already half way to understanding Ignosticism and Theological Noncognitivism, because that's how they feel about the statement ""God exists"". It's an acknowledgement of the fact that the word ""God"" has meant billions of different things to billions of different people, from ""a magical man who lives on top of that mountain and demands that we sacrifice goats to him"" to ""a mystical love-force that mystically touches people's hearts through completely undetectable means"" to ""like, the entire Universe is God, man. Whoah!"", and that many of these definitions are themselves silly, unfalsifiable, self-contradictiory, or incoherent. Indeed, when backed into a corner, apologists like playing silly games with the definitions of words like ""exist"", too. Therefore, ignostics and theological noncognitivists hold that it's futile to try to make statements about ""God"" unless the person you're talking to is willing to rigorously define what they mean by ""God"" first, preferably using falsifiable statements that constrain anticipation, rather than nonsense about ""faith""."
atheism,secular humanism ,"Secular Humanism is a philosophy that "" embraces human reason, ethics, social justice and philosophical naturalism, whilst specifically rejecting religious dogma, supernaturalism, pseudoscience or superstition as the basis of morality and decision making."" Basically, it's about being good for goodness' sake, rather than because some invisible bully in the sky told you to."
atheism,transhumanism ,"Transhumanism is a philosophy which states that the human condition can and should be improved, and improved drastically. It advocates the use of science and technology to fight disease, hunger, poverty, and aging, to enhance the physical and mental capabilities of individuals, and eventually to colonize the solar system and beyond. Prominent Transhumanist Elizer Yudowkoski explains that, in his opinion, Transhumanism is simply Humanism simplified, with no ""you should stop helping people after this point"" line. Critics of Transhumanism tend to poke fun at its Science-Fiction trappings and its overly optimistic attitude."
atheism,skepticism,"Skepticism is, basically, the philosophical position that all beliefs should be supported by evidence. Beloved skeptic Carl Sagan coined the phrase ""Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence"". It is far easier to convince a skeptic that you have a pet cat than that you have a pet blue whale, and far easier to convince them that you have a pet whale than that you have a pet unicorn. Applied Skepticism is often known as The Fine Art of Baloney Detection."
atheism,rationalism ,"Rationalism is the belief that Logic is supreme. Logic is extremely useful, but limited by the fact that one's conclusions are only as reliable as the premises one feeds into the logical framework. Proponents of the strong form of Rationalism (such as Ren√© Descartes) love making a priori arguments and tend to fall prey to the ""Garbage In, Garbage Out"" effect. When you apply sufficient skepticism to your choice of premises, however, Rationalism begins to resemble Rationality, which is a potent tool indeed."
atheism,materialism ,"Materialism is, essentially, the position that there's no such thing as magic, and that everything that exists is made of either matter or energy. It doesn't rule out the existence of types of matter or energy with which we are unfamiliar, but tends to frown on pseudoscientific misuse of the word ""energy"" to mean ""magical woo-woo"". Methodological Naturalism, an important component of the scientific method, basically says ""In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, let's at least do science as though materialism is true. Because otherwise what's to stop us from assuming that everything is run by invisible undetectable pixies?"""
atheism,empiricism ,"Empiricism (Particularly Pragmatism) is the philosophical position that, basically, observation of the real world is the only way to learn things about the real world, and that endeavors such as ""faith"" and ""divine revelation"" are useless for gaining knowledge. If you want to make an accurate map of a city, you can't sit in your room being ""inspired"" to draw random lines on a piece of paper, you actually have to observe the layout of the city in some way. Empiricists popularized and began to formalize the process of using experiments as a method of asking the universe questions."
atheism,positivism ,"Positivism began, basically, as the statement that ""that which cannot be settled by experiment is not worth thinking about"". When it quickly became obvious that the philosophical validity of that statement itself could not really be settled by experiment (d'oh!), gentlemen like Karl Popper got a hold of it and molded it into a refinement of philosophical empiricism and methodological naturalism."
atheism,postmodernism,"Postmodernism is basically a reaction of artists and squishy-philosophers who objected to the idea of scientists and more rigorous philosophers harshing their mellow. When taken to its extreme, it states that all reality is just made up of social constructs, and that facts are just, like, your opinion, man."
atheism,Nihilism,"Nihilism is a collection of philosophies which state that such-and-such a thing is without inherent meaning. Existential Nihilists in particular argue that life and existence itself are without inherent meaning, while Moral Nihilists argue that any established moral values are just social constructs. That's not to say that being a nihilist necessarily makes one a psychopath or a depressed teenager- most nihilists are perfectly capable of making their own meaning to things, they simply reject the idea of there being any deeper meaning than that."
atheism,Argument from Ignorance,"I don't know how X works, therefore the only possible explanation is my favourite explanation."" Often takes the form of ""Well, you haven't proven P to be 100% impossible, therefore P."" Requires ignoring the Burden of Proof (see above). Just because you don't know how electricity works is not sufficient reason to conclude that lightning is javelins hurled by an angry Zeus."
atheism,Argument from Personal Incredulity.,"I don't understand P, therefore P can't be true. If you think Quantum Physics is counter-intuitive, tough luck. It verifiably and reliably works, which means that the problem isn't with Quantum Physics but with your ability to understand it."
atheism,God of the Gaps,"""Science can't explain X yet, therefore X is proof of God!"" In ancient times, ""X"" has been ""the sun"", ""lightning"", ""disease"", ""the change of the seasons"", ""rainbows"", and ""the diversity of life"". Popular values for X today include ""Consciousness"" and ""The Big Bang""."
atheism,Appeal to Authority,"Claiming that an argument is more valid simply because the person making it has a fancy title or is wearing a fancy hat, regardless of whether these things would actually make them an expert on the subject, and particularly regardless of any actual evidence on the subject. ""Lord Kelvin says that heavier than air flying machines are impossible. Who are you going to believe, him, or a couple of bicycle repair men from North Carolina?"""
atheism,Appeal to Popularity,"Insisting that something must be true just because enough people believe in it. ""Millions of people play the lottery every week- are you trying to tell me that none of them understand basic mathematics?"""
atheism,Equivocation,"An argument that switches from using one meaning of a word to using another, and hopes that no one will notice the switch. ""All feathers are light. Light things are not dark. Therefore, no feather is dark."""
atheism,The Noncentral Fallacy,"The Noncentral fallacy consists of taking your emotional reaction or assessment of a central or archetypical member of a category, and then generalizing that assessment or emotional reaction to every member of that category, however peripheral. More formally, this usually takes the form of broadening your definition of Category X (in such a way that membership doesn't require Attribute Y) so that the category can include Object Z, then turning around and arguing that because Object Z is in your newly redefined Category X, it must have Attribute Y. For example, ""I define 'criminal' to be anyone who breaks a law. Therefore, Martin Luther King Jr. is a criminal. Therefore (because criminals are dangerous individuals who hurt people for their own personal gain), he should be feared and hated, locked up and perhaps executed."" ""I define 'human' to be any organism with human DNA. Therefore, human zygotes are humans. Therefore (because humans can think and feel and we consider unique thoughts and feelings to be precious), the existence of zygotes should be protected just as strongly if not moreso than those of adult humans."""
atheism,wishful thinking ,"An argument that, because you would be sad if P were true, P cannot be true. ""If smoking causes lung cancer, that means I might get lung cancer some day! I don't want to get lung cancer, therefore smoking doesn't cause lung cancer."" ""If we don't have immortal souls, we stop existing when we die. I don't want to stop existing. Therefore, I have an immortal soul."""
atheism,Appeal to Adverse Consequences,"A closely related argument that, since bad things would happen if people believed in P, that P must be false. ""If people started thinking that homosexuals aren't all degenerate perverts, people might not be motivated to stop them from getting married or adopting children! Well, we can't have that!"
atheism,Fallacies of Composition and Division,"Two closely related fallacies which involve trying to assign attributes of a gestalt object to all its components, or vice versa. Composition: Human beings have consciousness. Human beings are in the universe. Therefore, the universe itself has consciousness. Division: Human beings have consciousness. Human beings are made up of cells. Therefore, cells have consciousness."
atheism,Begging the Question,"A circular argument where the one of the premises relies on the conclusion, or where conclusion is disguised as one of the premises. When you notice this, you realize that only makes any sense if you already agree with the conclusion. Events in the Bible were attested to by many eyewitnesses (according to the Bible). Events attested to by eyewitnesses are reliable. Therefore, everything that the Bible says happened, happened. This ""eye witness testimony"" is only valid if you already believe that the story is true."
atheism,Straw Man Fallacy,"Ignoring your opponent's argument, and instead attacking a superficially similar but much easier to defeat argument. One then claims that because one has defeated the scarecrow, one has defeated one's opponent. ""Since no one has ever seen a dog give birth to a cat, Evolution must be impossible."" ""You think Islam is bad because we all kill people, but I've never killed anyone, therefore Islam isn't bad."""
atheism,Genetic Fallacy,"Insisting that a concept or idea is inherently bad because of where it comes from, regardless of any merit that the idea itself has. ""I can't support NASA. Many of the pioneers in the field of rocketry were working for the Nazis, and you don't want to go into space on Nazi machines, do you?"" ""The Qu'ran says that we should give to the poor, and everything in the Qu'ran is wrong, therefore we shouldn't give to the poor."""
atheism,Texas Sharpshooter Fallacy,"If one wild guess out of a thousand turns out to be kinda right, a dishonest person can make a huge deal out of that one guess (and exaggerating how right it is), while quietly sweeping the 999 incorrect guesses under the rug. Especially popular with regards to prophecies, but also among people who like to claim that vague poetic nonsense in primitive books are actually secret metaphors for future scientific discoveries. If you fling enough crap at a wall, eventually some of it is going to stick. But if you then paint a bullseye around that one piece and proclaim yourself to be a sharpshooter, everyone is going to think you're a jackass. More formally, this is the fallacy of using the same data to both construct and test your hypothesis."
atheism,Special Pleading,"Stating that all X are Y, but then stating that one particular X doesn't need to be Y, for no adequately explained reason. Everything that exists has a cause. There can't be an infinite chain of causes. Therefore, there must be a thing that caused everything else, and that's God. (No, God doesn't need a cause. Why? Shut up, that's why.)"
atheism,No True Scotsman,"Stating that all X are Y. When someone points out an X that isn't Y, claiming that that particular X isn't a true X, for no adequately explained reason. Named after the most common example: ""No Scotsman puts sugar in his porridge!"" ""Hamish MacDoogle puts sugar in his porridge."" ""Well, no true Scotsman puts sugar in his porridge!"" Popular among religious moderates who like to claim that extremists aren't really following the same god that they're following, and among extremists to claim the same things about the moderates."
atheism,Appeal to Nature,"An argument that ""natural"" things are inherently good and ""unnatural"" things are inherently bad. ""I don't want to treat my disease with chemicals, regardless of how high that success rate might be. I'd rather use some stuff I found in my garden, because they're all natural, and natural things are completely safe."""
atheism,False Dilemma,"In logic, A and not-A can't both be true or both be false. Either this thermometer is reading a number greater than 30¬∫, or it's reading a number less-than-or-equal-to 30¬∫- it can't be both, and it can't be neither. A false dilemma is when you pretend that this rule applies to a situation to which it doesn't apply, for example: ""Either it's hot out today, or it's cold out today"" ignores whatever range of temperatures lies between ""hot"" and ""cold"". ""Either you support our unilteral invasion of this unrelated foreign country, or you support the Terrorists!!"" ignores the possibility that you might support neither agenda. This often takes the form of ""Either P or Q. If P then R, and if Q then R, therefore R"", which completely ignores the possibility that P and Q might both be false. ""If grandma is healed through the power of God, then it proves that God is good. If grandma dies and goes to heaven, then it proves that God is good. Therefore, God is good."""
atheism,Fallacy of Gray,"Rejecting a black-and-white outlook on things, but taking this rejection too far, replacing a two-colour worldview with a one-colour worldview. Stating that since neither Proposition X or Proposition Y is absolutely completely and undeniably 100% true, that they must contain exactly the same amount of truth. Popular among Postmodernists and other assorted hippies."
atheism,Appeal to Force,"Also known as the ""Argumentum ad Baculum"" (argument from the stick), this consists of threatening your opponent with all the bad things that will happen to them if they don't agree with you. ""Agree with me, or I will hit you with this stick!"" ""Agree with me, or my invisible friend will set you on fire!"""
atheism,"Post Hoc, Ergo Propter Hoc","Latin for ""After this, therefore because of this"". Related to ""Cum Hoc, Ergo Propter Hoc"" (with this, therefore because of this). An argument that because X happened before Y happened, X was the cause of Y. ""I prayed for my headache to go away. Then my headache went away. Therefore, my prayers caused the headache to go away."" Tends to ignore all the times that X happens but fails to cause a Y (You prayed, but your headache didn't go away), or all the times that a Y happens in the absence of X (I didn't pray, but my headache went away anyway), or any other potential causes for Y (Headaches tend to go away on their own after a while. Also, you took an asprin). Properly establishing causation requires taking all of these variables into account, which is why scientists use things like Fischer's Theorem and Bayes' Theorem."
atheism,Magical Thinking,"A psychologist named B.F. Skinner found that if he gave pigeons a treat every time they pressed a button, they'd start pressing the button more. No surprise there. But if he gave them treats completely at random, they would start doing more of whatever they happened to be doing when they got the treat (standing on one leg, walking backwards, etc) and as time went on (and they were given more random treats), their behaviour got more and more complex. In short, they became superstitious. Magical Thinking is the belief that X causes Y ""magically"", even if you can't come up with any mechanism by which X can cause Y. This tends to be reinforced by Confirmation Bias, which causes people to pay attention to things that suggest that they're right, and ignore things that suggest that they're wrong."
atheism,Cognitive Biases,"The human brain is a slap-dash, jury-rigged machine, and it has all sorts of ways of playing tricks on you. The first step in minimizing the effects of these tricks is to learn to recognize them when they appear."
atheism,Confirmation Bias,"People tend to pay attention to evidence that suggests that they're right, and ignore evidence that suggests that they're wrong. For example, if you were trying to say that all Mexicans were lazy, and you find a Mexican guy sleeping on the job, you'd hold this as proof of your claim- even though you've ignored any hard working or diligent Mexicans you might see. It's not enough for there to be some evidence that supports your claim, it must conclusively outweigh the evidence against it. This is why the modern scientific method spends more time looking for the second kind of evidence than the first."
atheism,Dunning-Kruger Effect,"The less competent people are at a skill, the less accurate they tend to be at judging their own competence in that skill. Tending to vastly overestimate it. Furthermore, they tend to be less accurate at judging other people's competence in that skill, and thus realizing that they might have something to learn from that guy with three PhDs who has spent fifty years working in the field. This is what leads to bad singers who don't realize that they can't sing, 1st year philosophy students who think they've found a loophole in the Theory of Special Relativity, and creationist ""professors"" who don't realize that they don't have the faintest clue how science works."
atheism,Cognitive Dissonance,"When your brain tries to hold one or more mutually contradictory ideas at the same time, this makes you highly uncomfortable. To make this discomfort go away, it tries to modify your beliefs to make them not contradictory anymore. This is theoretically a very good idea, but the subconscious process that your brain uses to decide which beliefs to modify and how to modify them leaves a lot to be desired. Rather than determining which of the contradictory beliefs is most likely to be untrue, your brain seems predisposed to chuck out whatever belief it can get away with while causing the least discomfort. Alternatively, it can invent nonsensical non-answers like ""the Lord works in mysterious ways"" which let you feel as though the conflict has been resolved even though it hasn't. For example: The Bible is the Word of God, and I agree with everything it says. I think murder, slavery, rape, child abuse, animal abuse, arson, torture, ritual mutilation, fratricide, patricide, matricide, infanticide, genocide, etc. are bad things. The Bible condones, commands, and commits murder, slavery, rape, child abuse, animal abuse, arson, torture, ritual mutilation, fratricide, patricide, matricide, infanticide, genocide, etc., often in direct and not-at-all metaphorical quotes from God. This contradiction has the following possible resolutions: Well, I guess I don't agree with everything the Bible says, then. It certainly isn't the word of a just god. Well, I guess kidnapping and raping children because their parents worship a different god than you do must be okay under certain circumstances. NO IT DOESN'T! LA LA LA I CAN'T HEAR YOU!!"
atheism,Cumulative Cognitive Dissonance,"Once you tell a lie, the truth is ever after your enemy, and continuing to defend a ridiculous belief means that one will have to keep accumulating more and more ridiculous beliefs to support it, investing yourself more and more heavily in the absurdity. Most people will (eventually) change their beliefs on a subject after enough contradictory evidence emerges. Because sometimes evidence emerges that is so solid and undeniable that it is easier to give up a complex worldview than having to constantly generate excuses why this evidence is false. Other individuals, especially when they have support networks of others reinforcing a delusion or worldview, will go to such great lengths to rationalize away dissenting ideas that after a certain point, an admission of error would cause the collapse of an entire web of mutually supporting beliefs."
atheism,Just-World Hypothesis,"This is the belief that all actions have predictable and just consequences, that bad things happen to bad people, and that good things happen to good people. This is the sort of attitude that blames rape victims because their hemlines were too short, or which thinks that poor people are just lazy slobs (or else they would have pulled themselves up by their bootstraps already). It's strongly correlated with people who believe in things such as ""Karma"" or ""God's Will"", but many other people can fall prey to it from time to time. After all, the alternative (that we live in a universe that simply doesn't give a fuck- which, as far as anyone can tell, is what appears to be the case) is kind of uncomfortable to think about."
atheism,Stockholm Syndrome,"Stockholm Syndrome and Battered Person Syndrome are phenomena frequently observed in kidnapped people and in victims of abusive relationships, with or without intentional brainwashing on the part of the abuser. It consists of attachment to or identification with ones abusers and coming to regard them as good and fair. They feel that their abusers are acting in their best interests, regardless of any evidence to the contrary, in a phenomenon known as paradoxical gratitude. Cognitive dissonance leads to the production of all sorts of excuses to justify this belief- thanking them for every small kindness, or even for simply not beating them quite as hard as they could have. Meanwhile, victims tend to believe than any violence or mistreatment must be their fault, because they ""failed"" their partner. It tends to be associated with self-blame and self-hatred, with victims feeling that they are somehow ""dirty"" or ""broken"", and that they are unworthy of their partner's love/affection/attention, or that they need their partner to feel whole. In extreme cases, the learned helplessness can lead to a belief that the abuser is omnipresent and omniscient, and will know if they even think about rebelling or leaving. Does any of this sound at all familiar?"
atheism,Battered Person Syndrome,"Stockholm Syndrome and Battered Person Syndrome are phenomena frequently observed in kidnapped people and in victims of abusive relationships, with or without intentional brainwashing on the part of the abuser. It consists of attachment to or identification with ones abusers and coming to regard them as good and fair. They feel that their abusers are acting in their best interests, regardless of any evidence to the contrary, in a phenomenon known as paradoxical gratitude.

atheism,Conformity Effect,"Solomon Asch conducted an experiment in which subjects were shown four lines, and asked to determine whether line A, B, or C was the same length as the fourth line. Unknown to the subjects, everyone else in the room was an actor, picking the wrong line on purpose. Subjects would initially pick the correct line (showing some discomfort) but eventually, most of them (~75%) would begin agreeing with the rest of the group, even though they were obviously incorrect. Further studies showed that this effect was somewhat reduced when the subject gave their answers anonymously, and greatly reduced when there was one other person disagreeing with the majority. In this scenario, the only thing that was at risk for the subject was a feeling of mild embarrassment. How much stronger must the effect be when pointing out that the Emperor Has No Clothes can get you publicly ridiculed, disowned by your family, or burned at the stake?"

bigbrother,BOTB,Battle of the Block
bigbrother,Power of Veto,"a special power that can be won and used to veto one of the Head of Household's nominations. Generally the Head of Household, the two nominees, and 3 people picked by a random draw play to win this."
bigbrother,Head of Household,"At the start of every week there is a competition to see who becomes the Head of Household. The Head of Household is in charge of nominating two people for eviction, and is also responsible for nominating a third person if the POV is used. The Head of Household is safe for the week but can‚Äôt play in next week's Head of Household competition - nor do they have a vote in who gets evicted unless a tie occurs. The Head of Household gets their own room and a basket of goodies personalized to them."
bigbrother,Diary Room,the room in the Big Brother house where the houseguests go to talk to the camera about their thoughts on the game.

bigbrother,Live Feeds ,The live feeds are a feature Big Brother offers where you can go online and watch a live feed of the inside of the Big Brother house in real time.
bigbrother,Have-nots,"On certain weeks, there will be a certain amount of people selected to be Have-Nots. This is sometimes chosen by a completion, and sometimes chosen by the current HoH. Have-Nots are not allowed to eat normal food, but instead slop (see below for what slop is) for the entire week - unless otherwise told they can. They are only permitted to have cold showers and must sleep in the ‚ÄúHave-Not Room‚Äù, which is always a room with some kind of unpleasant feature to it such as uncomfortable beds, minimal blankets and/or freezing temperatures."
bigbrother,Slop ,Sometimes this is the only food that have-nots are allowed to eat. It is like a gross porridge and is very disgusting according to every house guest.
bigbrother,America‚Äôs Favorite Player,a prize worth 25k given to the viewers favorite player at the end of the season. This is chosen by a vote during the last few weeks.

bigbrother,Pandora's Box,"a twist in season 11, 12, 13 and 14. At random times, a HoH would find a new door in their room with a question mark on it. If the HoH opens it, it is a toss up if it will be a punishment or a reward for the HoH. If the HoH gets a reward, then the rest of the house gets a punishment and vise versa."
bigbrother,Coup D'etat,A twist in a few season which allows someone to remove both nominations and make their own. The only people who can't be nominated are the HoH and the veto winner. This also causes the HoH to be terminated and the old HoH can compete again next week without a buffer week.
bigbrother,Mist,"a term coined by Dan Gheesling of BB10 and BB14. It is a term he used when manipulating people. When manipulating them into doing something he wanted, he would call it misting them."
bigbrother,Planting a Seed,"the act of planting doubt in another persons head so that they will do something you want them to do, but they get the blood on their hands instead."
bigbrother,Blood on my hands,"a term used to describe the act of being directly involved in evictions of houseguests. The more work you do to get someone evicted, the more blood you have on your hands."
bigbrother,Rob Has a Podcast,"a well known podcast hosted by past Survivor player Rob Cesternino, where he talks about a multitude of reality shows including Big Brother. He usually has a past houseguest on each episode. A lot of fans like to listen to his podcasts."
bigbrother,Dan‚Äôs Funeral,"a famous play Dan made in BB14. It is usually regarded as one the greatest moves in Big Brother history. If you don't plan on watching season 14 but would like to watch his funeral, you can watch it here. In any case, it is strongly recommended that you just watch the season."

For example, it is inappropriate to make moral judgments of a person based on their involuntary membership in a group such as: males, ethnic Jews, the mentally/physically disabled, Asians, bisexuals, the elderly, etc. On the other hand, it may be appropriate to make moral judgments based on voluntary group membership. For example it may be appropriate to condemn a person who can be classed as a thief, a white supremacist, a wife-beater, or to praise a person who can be classed as a philanthropist, a social reformer, or a patriot."

Holy Tradition is the life of the Holy Spirit in the Church. He leads the Church ""into all truth"" (Jn 16:13) and enables her to preserve the truth taught by Christ to His apostles. The Scriptures are the core of this Tradition, as interpreted through the writings of the Fathers, the Ecumenical Councils, and the worship of the Church.

For a while, Bowler would fill a role over either Ice Spirit, Mini PEKKA, or Musketeer, and Prince would gain momentum in Mini PEKKA's spot to use against Bowler. When the Mega Minion was released, a standard Goison deck emerges: Giant / Poison / Mega Minion / Elixir Collector / Zap / Prince / Ice Spirit / Guards (or sometimes Musketeer).

cricket,Koach,"Virat Kohli. Due to an 'untenable relationship' with India coach Anil Kumble, Kumble stepped down as India coach after the 2017 Champions Trophy final. Murmurs that Kohli and Kumble had disagreed on quite a few things during his one-year tenure as coach led to this nickname. Not supported by the fact that India's coach after Kumble was Ravi Shastri, a noted supporter of Kohli and all but a yes-man to many people."
cricket,TALENTTM,"Rohit Sharma, the great talent of Indian cricket. Has several extra seconds to play the ball. Koach disagrees and says he has more than one."
cricket,World Blowjob XI,"How are these players still picked for their team? Rumor has it that they give great blowjobs. Examples include: James Vince, Jake Ball, Lahiru Thirimanne."
cricket,KaneTrain,"Literally the only reason New Zealand are still alive Kane Williamson/Kane Williamson achieving a landmark. Used because the New Zealand team have mostly been looked upon as underdogs that punch above their weight. Williamson is one of the 'Big Four' of World Cricket, and sometimes has to bat early because the New Zealand openers get out. Takes wickets with handy offspin and is a good fielder as well. TICKETS PLEASE"

cricket,Noice Garry,"Nathan Lyon doing something remarkable. When Matthew Wade was behind the stumps keeping to Lyon, the stump mike picked it up. Spelled 'noice' because of Wade's way of saying it."
cricket,GOAT,"Nathan Lyon. Holds the record for the most number of wickets by an Australian offspinner, and a well-liked person."
cricket,INTENT,"Originally a sparsely-used nickname for Shikhar Dhawan (TALENT and INTENT at the top of India's batting order), it has ascended due to Kohli's team selections for the 2018 South Africa tour being players that 'show positive intent', even though they have been exposed against balls that move in the air."
cricket,Moral Victory,"Doing something that the opposition didn't do, or achieving a milestone. Nearly always used when the team is losing. Examples: Root scored 100 runs while Faf scored 99 runs, even though England are trailing by 300 runs and at 9 wickets down. Truly a moral victory. / India got to 50-7 after being 27-7 against the Sri Lankan bowling attack. Moral Victory."
cricket,Naagin,"A form of Cobra dance popular in subcontinent and frequently performed by Bangladesh players, and by Sri Lankan players in retaliation. Naagin was at its its zenith during and after the Nidahas Trophy last league game between Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. The entire Bangladesh team along with their support staff performed the dance after defeating SL in a thrilling finish."
cricket,New Australia,"The New Australian side which undertook major reforms after the leadership group fucked up. AKA the Aussie side without Smith and Warner.

Lyon decided to go full alpha and cuckold AB de Villiers by sledging him and then came the worst event of the whole series. During the 4th test match, Cameron Bancroft was seen to be stuffing a yellow piece of paper into his trousers - this was later to be identified as sandpaper. Aussie coach Darren Lehmann was on a walky-talky to Peter Handscomb telling them they had been rumbled but later denied he knew anything about it. Smith and Bancroft did a press conference right after the day's play and the ""leadership group"" was blamed.

The rider leans forward into the wind, the force of which can comfortably support the rider's weight at speeds near 100 mph (160 km/h), but at lower speeds leaves too much weight on the arms and wrists, causing fatigue, unless legs are used to support the back, arms and wrist. They're usually classified as having higher horsepower output and, as such, are good candidates for ""track days""."
motorcycles,Standard,"Motorcycle recognized primarily by their upright riding position, partway between the reclining rider posture of the cruisers and the forward leaning sport bikes. Footpegs are below the rider and handlebars are high enough to not force the rider to reach far forward, placing the shoulders above the hips in a natural position. Because of their flexibility, lower costs and their engines of moderate output, standards are particularly suited to motorcycle beginners."
motorcycles,Cruiser,"Cruisers are styled after American machines from the 1930s to the early 1960s, such as those made by Harley-Davidson, Indian, and Excelsior-Henderson. Harley-Davidsons largely define the cruiser category, and large-displacement V-twin engines are the norm, although other engine configurations and small to medium displacements also exist. Their engines are tuned for low-end torque, making them less demanding to ride because it is not necessary to shift as frequently to accelerate or maintain control. Cruisers are sometimes called ""custom"" even in the absence of aftermarket modifications."
motorcycles,Sport-Tourer,"Combines attributes of sport bikes and touring motorcycles. The rider posture is less extreme than a sport bike, giving greater long-distance comfort. Accommodation for a passenger is superior to a sport bike as well, along with increased luggage capacity."
motorcycles,Dual-sport," Dual-sports, sometimes called dual-purpose or on/off-road motorcycles, are street legal machines that are also designed to enter off-road situations. Typically based on a dirt bike chassis, they have added lights, mirrors, signals, and instruments that allow them to be licensed for public roads. They are higher than other street bikes, with a high center of gravity and tall seat height, allowing good suspension travel for rough ground."

purplepilldebate,TBP,"/r/TheBluePill, a subreddit satirising The Red Pill. It does not offer an alternative strategy to TRP."
purplepilldebate,TRP,"/r/TheRedPill , a subreddit offering Red Pill sexual strategy, examples and advice."
purplepilldebate,All Women Are Like That,"This is an RP term used to denote the commonality of female human nature, and to act as a warning that every woman has the capability to act in this manner if they are not doing so already. RP generally states that AWALT is a Heuristic (a rule that if not always true gives beneficial results if it is always assumed to be true). It serves as a reminder/warning for men to stay vigilant, that no one is an exception and that there is no ""unconditional love"". As such it is often compared to ""Treat All Guns as Loaded"" a similar heuristic. Although, to be strictly fair, RP also uses AWALT because it really annoys BP posters, and their general propensity to treat all humans as individuals."
purplepilldebate,Alpha,"/r/theredpill defines this as ""Leader. Somebody who displays high value, or traits that are valued by women. Alpha can refer to a man who exhibits alpha behaviours (more alpha tendencies than beta), but usually used to describe individual behaviours themselves. Alpha, or Alpha Traits, are those traits the RP model of human sexuality defines as ""Instinctively Sexually Attractive"" such as height and status in males, or youth and WHR in females. As such it aligns closely with ""Markers of Genetic Fitness"" as described in Evolutionary Psychology. However, it is independent of this source and RP includes things in Alpha traits based on experience in real world dating even if there is no scientific backing."
purplepilldebate,Alpha Bucks,"In RP terminology an Alpha Bucks (AB) is a guy high in Alpha attributes and Beta attributes. As such within the RP system he would be attractive as both a STR and LTR partner to women. Sometimes refereed to as a ‚ÄúHigh Beta‚Äù, a man desirable both sexually and in a relationship sense. A fictional equivalent could be Christian Gray, attractive and a billionaire. An archetype might be ‚Äúthe school football star who went to Yale and got a law degree‚Äù. An ancestral example might be the attractive young hunter who is also heir to the chief."
purplepilldebate,Alpha Fucks,"In RP terminology an Alpha Fucks (AF) is a guy high in Alpha attributes but low in Beta attributes. As such within the RP system he would be attractive as a STR partner to women, but less attractive as an LTR prospect. Equivalent with the classic ‚ÄúAlpha‚Äù stereotype. A man desirable sexually, but not a good relationship candidate. A fictional equivalent could be Brad Pitt as Tyler Durden, attractive but unstable. An archetype might be ‚Äúthe biker bad boy‚Äù. An ancestral example might be the attractive young hunter who is also prone to disappearing for years on end, or fighting constantly with other males, or for constantly switching women. RP also believes that in the ancestral environment more such men would have been violent, and many would have been diagnosed with the Dark Triad of Narcissism, Machiavellianism and Psychopathy in todays medical community."
purplepilldebate,"Alpha Fucks, Beta Bucks","RP concept which argues women have a dualistic mating strategy. This theory posits that hypergamy will drive women to seek out both alpha and beta qualities in men. If women cannot find both sets of traits in the same man, they will acquire beta through marriage or other LTRs with a beta (Beta Bucks - BB) while still sleeping with alphas (Alpha Fucks - AF). RP in general believes AF/BB is a women primary mating strategy, a significant minority say AB strategy is the primary strategy, and AF/BB only a secondary strategy. Women past the age of 30 are much more likely to be pursuing AF/BB strategies according to RP in general. A lot of RP advice to it‚Äôs natural Beta membership is geared towards avoiding becoming the BB in an AF/BB triangle relationship, and pursuing an AF role instead often by Spinning Plates. TBP criticizes both the alpha/beta dichotomy as well as the ability to generalize about women as a whole."
purplepilldebate,Becky,Used to denote a normal average woman.
purplepilldebate,Beta,"""Traits of provision: either providing resources or validatation to others, women (and perhaps men). Beta traits display low value to women if they are are put on too strong or too early in meeting- giving without equity. Beta can be used to describe individual behaviors, as well as people who have an overwhelming amount of beta properties (opposed to alpha)."" Beta, or Beta Traits, are those traits the RP model of human sexuality defines as ""Traits that are Attractive in a long term relationship partner, but which do not increase sexual attractiveness"" such as money and willingness to commit in males, or fidelity and homemaking skills in females. As such it aligns closely with ""Providership"" as described in Evolutionary Psychology for males and ""Fidelity/Non-Promiscuity"" in females. However, it is independent of this source and RP includes things in Beta traits based on experience in real world dating even if there is no scientific backing."
purplepilldebate,Beta Bucks,"In RP terminology a Beta Bucks (BB) is a guy low in Alpha attributes and high in Beta attributes. As such within the RP system he would be attractive as an LTR (but not STR) partner to women. Equivalent with the classic ‚ÄúBeta‚Äù stereotype. A man desirable as a relationship candidate much more than as a sexual partner. A fictional equivalent could be Clark Griswold, unattractive but stable family man. An archetype might be ‚Äúthe accountant your mum wants you to marry‚Äù. An ancestral example might be the unattractive but reliable hunter who is looking for a family. RP also believes that in the ancestral environment there would have been fewer such men and it has been the long civilising influence of post-agricultural history, and the modern turn to feminine values, that has produced so many men inclined to be natural Betas."
purplepilldebate,Beta Orbiters,"Similar to the Nice Guy, ""A beta guy who accepted the proposal to ""just be friends"" from a girl he has oneitis for. He will stick around her and constantly validate her whenever she requests it. Also known as ""friendzone."" She will keep him around because he will do anything for her and provide validation, giving small hints that he might eventually win her love- but he never will. Typical signs of orbiter status: likes and comments on new facebook photos. Go-to guy when girl has problem with boyfriend. Also known as emotional tampon."" - /r/theredpill"
purplepilldebate,Black Pill,"A part of the Incel affiliated sphere. Guys (they're always guys) who have understood RP's model of human mating and male and female behaviour driven by genetics, but have then chosen to use that model as a reason why pursuit of women is pointless, for them. RP Views: They took our pill, in terms of the information and terminology, but took another course in their strategic response to RP information. The Red Pill shows you how to use it's knowledge to improve yourself and achieve your goals. The Black Pill uses Red Pill knowledge to convince fellow males it's impossible to get ""attractive"" girls so why even try ? Crab-Bucketing other young men into fucking up their lives too, RP knowledge used as a reason for nihilism.They're soooooo whiny. BP Views: These idiots are a branch of the misogynistic idiots round here. This bunch of crazy people think that women are out to get them, or to refuse to steal their precious bodily fluids, or something. All their woes are due to women. Blue Pill generally believes this is because they're ugly, and they're whiny ass whiners. They say while maybe a woman can overlook the ugly for a decent guy. But when you've got a face like a bag of spanners and are ALSO a negative, whiny, idiot that believes the same shit as the other misogynistic idiots round here then why would a woman want to date that guy? These guys do it to themselves. They're soooooo whiny. Black pill View: We're awesome. They're all deluded. We have a true objective view of the real reality. Neither of their ""the guy who actually tries hard and does the right things wins in the end"" bullshit is true. The world is a cold bleak place where everyone but me has a chance, and I always lose. But we are NOT whiny. We'll we do whine a bit. But it's only because it's all so unfair, so it really is hopeless for me because of $Why_I_cant_get_women. AND I've got a face like a bag of spanners. The universe is awful. It should all just burn. OK. Maybe I agree. We're soooooooo whiny."

purplepilldebate,Chad,"The archetypal natural highly desirable male. Usually held out to be maximally naturally attractive across all Alpha attributes. To RP chad is an archetypal competitor in the realm of sexual strategy. Something that can be used as a goad to action, or a boogeyman. Chad is always better than you are, and naturally so. He is a target to beat. To Black Pill/Incel types Chad is an unattainable level that makes the whole enterprise pointless and not worthwhile. If you can't compete with Chad, why bother ? Why not just wank into a sock and play WoW and in other ways enjoy your life. Chad is a stupid term for a stupid idea made by stupid people applying stupid theories to a stupid premise that everyone knows is wrong anyway. Those idiots use it for all the crap you can see to the left but it's all just them circlejerking about hot guys really."
purplepilldebate,Cock Carousel,"RP term referring to the young men western women have sex with in their youth. ""Riding the cock carousel"" means that a woman is having casual sex with multiple partners, or engaging in extremely short lived, serial, monogamous relationships. TBP views this concept as a form of slut-shaming. Many bluepillers also dispute its accuracy."
purplepilldebate,Dark Triad,"Dark triad is a pop-cultural and scientific term for humans who have 3 clinically diagnosable psychiatric traits of Narcissism, Machivellianism and Psychopathy. RP believe that in the ancestral environment where human sexuality evolved men who had these traits were far more successful than in modern society, and that consequently some or all women (depending on how deep red they are) are attracted to males who genuinely have these behaviours. RP makes it clear that actually having these behaviours in the modern world tends to land you in jail relatively quickly and so ""Being Dark Triad"" is a) not something to emulate and b) not something any human can do in any case, because those guys are fucked up in ways you can't replicate by trying to be a hardass"
purplepilldebate,Dread Game,Within RP this refers to a specific strategy designed to help married RPM turn around unsuccessful marriages. Generally from the starting condition that sex has dried up and divorce may be in the offing.
purplepilldebate,Endorsed Contributor,Some TRP members have been endorsed by the mods of the site as presenting views consistent with RP. These users have a flair denoting their status as an Endorsed Contributor or EC.
purplepilldebate,Feminine Imperative,"The sexual interests of women as a group. Also known as ""The Feminine Reality."" /r/TheRedPill believes that for women to actualize their sexual goals, men must sacrifice their's, and vice-versa. The Feminine Imperative refers to laws, social conventions and conditioning, and cultural forces that structure society so that women's sexual strategy can be successful. /r/TheRedPill interprets this as meaning that society is built around giving women the best chance of fulfilling their hypergamy. Bluepillers might deny the existence of The Feminine Imperative, or see female sexual interests as having been historically repressed by patriarchy or other sociopolitical forces."
purplepilldebate,Hamster,"Someone who is rationalizing something, especially if trying to find a ""good"" reason to have done a ""bad"" thing. (to) Hamster : used in both red and blue pill subreddits, it means to rationalize something to oneself."
purplepilldebate,Holding Frame,"Frame is the implicit set of assumptions and expectations used to interpret a social situation. Holding frame refers to asserting control over the meaning and direction of an interaction. Frame is the implicit set of assumptions and expectations used to interpret a social situation. Holding frame refers to asserting control over the meaning and direction of an interaction. Bluepillers may interpret redpill advice about frame control as unnecessary, domineering, or excessive."
purplepilldebate,Hypergamy,"The official definition is to marry above your station/social class, but the RP concept mainly refers to women seeking men that are ""better than they are"". That is likely to mean station/class but could also mean education level, social standing, other sources of prestige or status more generally. BP criticism on this is that men are also prone to trade up for immature reasons so the emphasis on women is unwarranted and unhealthy since it leads to resentment and anger."
purplepilldebate,Incel,A person who describes themselves as involuntarily celibate. Often moany as fuck with it too.
purplepilldebate,Just Be Yourself,"An often discussed topic; RPers complain it is too idealistic or simplistic while BPers claim pretending to be someone you're not won't work either. Depending on the individual, ""Be yourself"" can mean to honor and trust in who you are rather than changing to fit the goals of someone or something else, or staying as you are and never learning or improving. RPers often contend JBY is too idealistic or simplistic. It‚Äôs a common RP view that this advises people to stay as they are, where they should be advised to change in specific ways that will add attraction. Commonly referring to RP beliefs as to what these actions are... Alpha Traits. BPers often contend pretending to be someone you're not won't work either and so Just Be Yourself gives the correct advice to everyone. To blue flairs Just be Yourself commonly means to honour and trust in who you are rather than changing to fit the goals of someone or something else (sometimes called ‚ÄúJust Be the best version of yourself‚Äù)."
purplepilldebate,Last Minute Resistance,"The act of a woman demurring from sex at the last minute, particularly after extended foreplay. Who wants to grasp this firecracker ? Oh BP have to write one hell of a response here.       "
purplepilldebate,Manosphere,"A loosely affiliated collection of blogs, forums and websites that deal with men, masculinity, and mens issues. In some parts favourable to RP, in other parts not. Other major components include MRA's and just general masculinity blogs like https://www.artofmanliness.com/ and https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/ A typical RP view of the the manoshphere might be that the RP-O-Sphere sits within the manosphere, within a venn diagram that RP-O-Sphere would be a smaller circle contained entirely within the larger circle that is the manosphere. And the MRAs are, basically, pussies. They've got the right idea. But they're pussies. The rest of the manosphere is pretty cool though. You should check it out."
purplepilldebate,Married Red pill,"A reddit sub at /r/marriedredpill that deals with using RP to understand sexual strategy within the context of Marriage. MRP is a breakaway sub from TRP and is independent of the TRP modding structure across most other red pill subs on reddit. (e.g. /r/askTRP). As such it does take different lines to TRP. MRP focusses on married males situations, or at least ""LTR'd males"" situations, and is a male sub. They have a different sidebar to TRP focussing on RPs application for married men, and leave the single RP game to the guys over on TRP."
purplepilldebate,Men Going Their Own Way,"This is another manosphere grouping loosely related to RP. It consists of Men who have chosen to seek value in pursuing their goals without regards to women... to ""go their own way"". Although MGTOW may still enter into sexual relationships with women, many seek to keep those informal. Others go further and eschew relationships with women except on a commercial basis. Other go even further and eschew women completely. A common RP view might be that MGTOW tend to share RP's view of human sexual relations, but where RP have decided to engage with this view of reality and use it to pursue their goals with women MGTOW have decided to engage with this view of reality by attempting to segregate women away from their chosen goals. Nevertheless /r/theredpill has an MGTOW flair for MGTOW posts, and MGTOW discussion does take place on TRP"

purplepilldebate,Not All Women Are Like That,"What RPers describe as ""the knee-jerk caricature bullshit BP response to any generalization."" BPers are critical of what they often see as sweeping generalizations based in pseudoscience coming from RPers. This originally arose as a ""standard"" response to someone claiming AWALT. Because the other side wanted to say NAWALT in response, we let them. So now they think they're clever. But all the women really ARE like that, so there."
purplepilldebate,Negging,"Whereby a man attempts to gain a woman's attention/attraction by using teasing jibes meant to diminish her self esteem in the hopes she will ""work for his approval"". Some RPers view teasing and light banter as negging as well. Negging is usually divided into hard and soft modes. Soft Negging is better known as ""playful banter"", generally an attempt to tease another about some aspect of them that is NOT a sore spot. Hard Negging is a deliberate strategy used on highly-attrac. BP criticism is that the first approach generally doesn't work out IRL, and the idea of ""taking her down a notch"" to be degrading. In respect to ""teasing and banter"", BPers are often perplexed as to why these RPers don't just call it that in the first place.tive women that is designed to hit a sore spot in an offhand of snide manner, with the intent of flustering her and giving the impression you consider her below you in the human dominance hierarchy"
purplepilldebate,Nice Guy,"A concept well-known outside TRP, it refers to a guy who willingly befriends - or has been rejected and remains friends with - a girl in the hope of starting a sexual or romantic relationship. The Nice Guy is disliked by both RPers and BPers, although for different reasons: RPers see the Nice Guy as a spineless beta who should move on. RPers often feel particularly strongly about Nice Guys as many viewed themselves to have been so in the past, especially as a result of having been encouraged to ""be a nice guy"" by family, friends or society. BPers see him as insincere and possibly discomforting and creepy based on the level of his advances and subsequent reaction to rejection. BPers criticize RPs rationale since there are also people who previously identified as Nice Guys but decided not to blame women or society for their problems."
purplepilldebate,Omega,"In RP terminology an Omega (O) is a guy low in Alpha attributes and Beta attributes. As such within the RP system he would be unattractive as both a STR and LTR partner to women. Equivalent with the classic ‚ÄúNeckbeard‚Äù stereotype. A man not desirable sexually or as a relationship candidate, unattractive and also lacking in ability to provide. An archetype might be ‚Äúthe fat and smelly guy who works at the supermarket and lives in moms basement‚Äù. An ancestral example might be the unattractive and bad hunter who is basically on the edge of starvation. RP also believes that in the ancestral environment there would have been fewer such men and it has been the long civilising influence of post-agricultural history, and the modern turn to feminine values, that has produced the cultural support required for so many men to be natural Omegas. RP would general say Vidya and Porn contribute, and turning them off would incline more current Omega‚Äôs to become Beta‚Äôs. An exceptionally unattractive person (usually male), often unattractive because he doesn't have his shit together and generally sucks at life. The 300-pound MLP-loving neckbeard who either sits at home or has a minimum-wage job bagging groceries and no ambition of better."
purplepilldebate,Oneitis,"""When a guy has fallen in love with a woman in the same way a boy loves his mother. He obsesses about her, but she does not reciprocate."" - /r/theredpill RPs term of One-itis tracks very closely to the psychological term Limerence. The feeling of heady love, an obsession, something that drives male and female behaviour in very early stages of courtship. However, in this case one sided. One-Itis is being hung up on the one. RP in general counsels the best way to get over Oneitis is to sleep with ALL the girls in the universe and then decide if you're still hung up on that first girl. Chances are, the Limerance will be gone. BPers usually call this unrequited or one-sided love."
purplepilldebate,Patriarchy,"""Patriarchy is a social system in which society is organized around male authority figures. In this system fathers have authority over women, children, and property. It implies the institutions of male rule and privilege, and is dependent on female subordination."" -Wikipedia"
purplepilldebate,Pick Up Artist,"Pick Up Artists are men who have attempted to learn the art of seduction through blogs, books and websites in order to better seduce women. RP is an outgrowth, a spin-off, of the PUA movement."
purplepilldebate,Purple Pill,"Although users generally lean more to one side or the other, some use this term to signal they agree with aspects of each pill but side with neither. There are also other colors used like black, pink or gold, but the meanings aren't fixed and depend on the individual."
purplepilldebate,Red Pill Women,Although RP as originally conceived was male focussed many women have come to understand RP concepts related to Sexual Strategy. Where they agree and then modify and use these concepts in order to serve a females purposes in the SMP/RMP they are a Red Pill Woman or Red Pill Wife.
purplepilldebate,Relationship Market Place,"TRP views this as ""A description of the free market that is long term pair bonding."", with the R denoting that this is the relationship marketplace where LTR (girlfriend/boyfriend, co-habitation, marriages) take place. In BP terms it means the post-dating world, particularly the stable relationships within this world. RMP is a core element RP approach to analysing human mating culture in regards to long term pair bonding or assessing partners for the purpose of childrearing. It is a marketplace where male and female humans exchange long term commitments wherever they both believe an exchange is worthwhile. The value you have averaged across all members of the opposite sex in this marketplace is your true RMV, the value of the commitment you can exchange with others in return for purely commitment to a monogamous arrangement."
purplepilldebate,Relationship Market Value,"The value of an individual's desirability in the relationship market place (e.g. GF/BF, Co-habitation, marriage) determined by supply and demand and usually expressed in a value ranging from 1-10 e.g. RMV7. This can be directly influenced by numerous factors including Alpha and Beta traits, the male/female ratio in that RMP, and other external factors like societal censures/pressures with regard to formal LTR arrangements. RMV is the summary of the value of an individuals monogamous commitment for an arrangement over the longer term. This becomes a vital component of mate selection where interests lie in the creation and raising of children. SMV (and so Alpha Traits) is a large component of RMV, but Beta Traits (money, trustworthiness, generosity) now come into play for males as providership traits add to your RMV (but not SMV). A general RP view is that for females ""markers of fidelity"" and ""past history of non-promiscuity"" are a vital component of female RMV, but not of female SMV"
purplepilldebate,RP-O-Sphere,"The wider world of RP thought of which reddit RP is just a part. The RP blogs, books, websites and other material that sits within the wider manosphere."
purplepilldebate,Sexual Market Place,"TRP views this as ""A description of the free market that is mating."", with the S denoting that this is the sexual marketplace where STR (ONS, FwB, short-duration ""flings"") take place. In BP terms it means the dating world, particularly hook-ups or short term flings within this world. SMP is a core element RP approach to analysing human mating culture in regards to short term sexual access. It is a marketplace where male and female humans exchange sexual access wherever they both believe an exchange is worthwhile. The value you have averaged across all members of the opposite sex in this marketplace is your true SMV, the value you can exchange with others in return for purely sexual access."
purplepilldebate,Sexual Market Value,"The value of an individual's desirability in the sexual market place (e.g. ONS, FwB, short term ""flings"") determined by supply and demand and usually expressed in a value ranging from 1-10 e.g. SMV7. This can be indirectly be influenced by numerous factors including the Alpha Traits (but not Beta traits) of a human, the male/female ratio in that SMP, and other external factors like societal censures/pressures with regard to STR. ""A shorthand statement for ‚Äúwhat you bring to the table,‚Äù whether for an one-night stand or for a longer sexual/emotional relationship."" - /r/theredpill. Often an analogy is drawn to economic market value in other markets (cars, labour) in the case where an individuals SMV is the ""price"" of sexual access to them, allowing economic analysis of the SMP. RP contends that Alpha traits increase SMV+RMV but that Beta traits only increase RMV. RP states that female SMV is reliant of markers of youth, fertility and genetic quality(e.g. attractiveness)"
purplepilldebate,Shit Tests,"In a relationship, a reaction test used to pass judgement on a potential or current partner, often requiring them to demonstrate authority and/or boundaries. TRP generally believes this to be a female specific behavior and involves either unconscious or conscious use of head games, for example questions with no right answer. RP believes women are sexually attracted to males they view above them in the human dominance hierarchy. They view many seemingly innocuous actions (e.g. ""can you just fetch me my purse?"") as being either conscious or subconscious ""pings"" of position within this hierarchy. With males who respond positively, and performing those actions, revealing their dominance position as lower than the woman in the interaction. RP generally believes that such ""shit tests"" have to be refused, perhaps in a humorous manner, if you are to maintain attraction that is received due to dominance position"
purplepilldebate,Solipsism,"Originally a philosophical position which points to the difficulty of knowing anything outside of one's own mind, and may question the existence of other beings entirely, it can also mean extreme egocentrism. Solipsism has been taken up by /r/theredpill as a term of art, and it is used to describe the way contemporary women relate to others. This ""Female Solipsism"" may involve self-absorbed behavior, inability to empathize, elements of narcissism, and the relentless rationalization of external events to justify one's own perspective. It frequently occurs when females try to estimate others mind states or motives, leading them to inadvertently assume a female typed motivation as a result. Can also refer to an inability to understand another point of view that is alien to the sex in question. Bluepillers may view /r/TheRedPill's use of solipsism as a bastardization of the original philosophical position, an inappropriate generalization, or projection on the part of redpillers."
purplepilldebate,Spinning Plates,"RP concept in which a man dates and sleeps with several women at once, similar to parallel dating. It can be conceived of "" A man with multiple FwB"". This may or may not involve informing the women about each other, and some RPers believe plate-spinning where the girls involved are aware there are other girls to be ""applied dread"". In some cases encounters are more frequent, or a FwB thing has been going on for a long time, and this girl can be referred to as his ""top plate"". Some RPers stress the importance of a woman knowing she is only a plate, honesty about the sexual situation. So that they never have ammo or justification to start drama when they decide they want to leave, and so they subconsciously compete with the other girls for your attention. Being honest also ensures you don't face social consequences for plate spinning and assists in easing your conscience, if you have it, as there is no doubt of the full informed consent. Nevertheless, many RP do lie to their plates and do try to hide them from each other. This can work, bur it's ultimately the choice of a weaker or less valuable male. BP criticisms focus mainly on being honest about dating around and not leading people on. The dispute that RP men are generally honest. They believe these relationships are usually rife with deception and lying by the RP male. And as if. BP also criticises the real ability of nerdy reddit-RP-numpties spouting warmed over bullshit to really * be dating 4 different ""HB 8's who are soooo DTF at the same time. It's common for Blue Pill flairs to believe 90% or 99% or 99.99% of ""plate theory"" is a made up wish fulfillment fantasy that very few RP males, if any, achieve."

purplepilldebate,The Wall,"RP concept that refers to the gradual decrease in Sexual Market Value of women at a certain age range, usually 25-35, with them ""hitting the wall"" in late 30's and early 40's and suffering a precipitous drop off in attractiveness that adds to the earlier gradual decline. .. Men also have their own Wall, but TRP contends that their wall sets in less rapidly and at a significantly later age, with men peaking in their late 20's and 30's, and then declining gradually over 40. Redpillers will say women of a certain age where fertility and looks are declining rapidly and simultaneously are ""hitting the wall."" usually in the late 30's at some point. The period moving up to that point, usually commencing around 30 for women who have not yet found a partner, is known as ""approaching the wall"". A period in which women are searching for a long term mate whilst they still have some of their youthful looks, before hitting the wall at the point her attractiveness drastically declines. While blue pillers will acknowledge a relationship between age and sexual attractiveness, they dispute the extent to which TRP's ""Wall"" concept is based in reality. A common bluepill criticism is that ""The Wall"" is more of an elaborate revenge fantasy than a real event in women's lives. Blue Pillers frequently notice the Twerps most vociferously defending the concept of ""The Wall"" are often those who perceive women have slighted them in the past and take obvious glee in the idea of women being disadvantaged. Older women can still be awesome. They're just awesome and older as well. A common Blue Pill view is that even though women do lose attractiveness, women still retain the upper hand in the dating market well through their 40's."

thedivision,Agent,"This is you. And your friends. And any other player you meet in The Division. You're part of a secret government cadre of highly trained civilians who are called on only in dire emergencies. Things in New York City are pretty dire, and it‚Äôs up to you and your fellow Agents to pull the city back from the brink."
thedivision,Armor,"The higher the Armor number of a given piece of gear, the less damage you will take. You don't like taking a lot of damage, do you? Of course not. Keep those Armor numbers high and getting higher."
thedivision,Base of Operations,"If you think your local post office is bad, wait until you see the Base of Operations for the first time. It's a fixer-upper, to put it mildly, but you're just the Agent to fix it up. Start by bringing each Wing online--the Medical, Tech, and Security Wings are your avenues to unlocking Skills, Talents, Perks, and more. As you earn more Supplies and spruce things up, you'll find a variety of Vendors and Crafting Tables to help you buy, sell, dismantle, and craft gear and weapons. Some areas will even start generating free items for you, and the whole place will just take on a more peaceful, functional vibe amidst the chaos."
thedivision,CERA,"The Catastrophic Emergency Response Agency folks were some of the first on the ground to set up quarantine and provide supplies to those affected. If you keep an eye out for their logo, you might find something helpful."
thedivision,Collectibles,"You'll learn a lot about what government agencies are up to during the pandemic, but what about the dad stuck at work while his kids are home alone? What about the family with plans to host relatives for the holidays? What about the less scrupulous folks looking to take advantage of the disaster? Seek out these collectibles for a fascinating array of Division stories. Seeing the uncertainty, the societal disruption, and the eventual chaos unfold from myriad different angles brings a strikingly human angle to these dire events. Plus, you get some XP bonuses, which is sweet."
thedivision,Commendation,"You‚Äôll be doing a lot of cool stuff in The Division, and Commendations are a way to track that cool stuff, reward you with cool stuff, and give you ideas on other cool stuff to do. Each one you accomplish adds to your Commendation Score, which gives other players an idea of how much cool stuff you‚Äôve been doing."
thedivision,Consumables,"Ever get so thirsty that, when you finally slug some water, you feel like you could jump over a building? You can't jump over buildings in The Division, but you can eat some canned food to boost your healing rate or drink water to increase the damage you do to elite enemies. Special bullets are also in this category; feed 'em to your gun and your gun will light bad guys on fire. Yummy."
thedivision,Contamination level,"There are some places in the city where the presence of the virus is still an active threat. If ISAC tells you your mask isn‚Äôt up to the task, you‚Äôd better listen and steer clear until you get a better mask filter by upgrading the wings of your Base of Operations."
thedivision,Cosmetic gear,"Anyone who tells you that cosmetic gear items do not affect your combat attributes is a) completely correct and b) lacking imagination. I always fight better with my stylish purple slouchy keeping my head warm. Find dress-up items in apartments, buy them from vendors, or receive them as gifts from grateful strangers when you share some food and water. You can also get rarer items, including backpack skins and multi-piece outfits, in Encrypted Caches at the Premium Vendor."
thedivision,Cover-to-cover movement,"Using cover is a great way to avoid getting shot to death in The Division, and moving between cover points is a great way to limit your exposure to enemy fire. Look towards a nearby car, barricade, or other cover position and you'll see a button prompt. Hold that button down and you'll scurry over there right quick, no other controls needed. Once you've safely arrived in your new cover, resume using all the other controls. You'll need them."
thedivision,ECHOs,"Created with a combination of surveillance data, audio records, and technological wizardry, these fascinating glimpses into the past reveal pivotal moments in the decline of New York and highlight key characters who had a role in the disaster. Walk around inside each holographic reconstruction to find all the points of interest and also see a cool effect when you pass through a person's image like whhhhoooaaaa it's kinda freaky."
thedivision,Emotes,"Whether you're saluting your allies for a mission well-cleared or applauding a dog in the street for being a good boy, never underestimate the importance of body language. And if you want to expand your vocabulary, you can learn new moves at the Premium Vendor."
thedivision,Encounters,"These missions give you small, but valuable supply boosts to help upgrade your Tech, Security, and Medical Wings."
thedivision,Enemy Factions,"As you progress through the streets of New York, you'll face off against hooligans with guns (Rioters), escaped prisoners with a penchant for violence (Rikers), fanatical flame-throwing goons (Cleaners), a private military company gone rogue (LMB), and, in a few special scenarios, deadly assassins with a thing for Division Agents (Hunters). Good luck!"
thedivision,Evasive Rolls,"You know that button you tap to get into cover, or hold to do a cover-to-cover move? Double-tap that button to dive and roll in the direction of your choice. Very helpful for getting away from the red-tinted areas where grenades are about to explode."
thedivision,Firearms,"These numbers appear at the top of your Inventory Overview screen and are an at-a-glance way to assess the power of your current Loadout. When considering a new weapon or gear item, check these numbers for a quick look at how it would affect these numbers. Trying to make these numbers get bigger is generally a good idea, but be aware that high-level weapons often have Talents requiring certain levels of Firearms/Stamina/Electronics and equip accordingly."

Trying to make these numbers get bigger is generally a good idea, but be aware that high-level weapons often have Talents requiring certain levels of Firearms/Stamina/Electronics and equip accordingly."
thedivision,Gear,"This refers to all the stuff you're wearing on your body that helps protect you and boost your skills. Gear slots include body armor, a mask, knee pads, a backpack, gloves, and a holster."
thedivision,The Green Poison aka The Dollar Flu,"This is the nasty bug that started killing a lot of people in early December, leading to a quarantine, riots, and the general tailspin that you find the city in. Think it was just a virus that happened to evolve naturally? Maybe start listening to your local pirate radio for some alternate theories."
thedivision,Grenade Types,"One of the perks of your government job is access to a variety of grenades, not just the garden-variety frag ones that explode real nice. Some set fires. Some make enemy gadgets break. Some shock enemies and freeze them in a rictus of pain. Hold down the Throw Grenade button to bring up a radial menu that allows you to choose which one to throw. Then throw it."
thedivision,ISAC,"Your friend, the Intelligent System Analytic Computer, will update your regularly on things that are happening in your world, including when a player joins or leaves your team, when you enter/leave a contaminated area, and when a variety of situational or mission-related things happen. It'll even tell you when you're dead. Computers are very helpful."
thedivision,JTF,"The Joint Task Force are the first responders that took a whack at containing the problems of the outbreak. It didn't go well, so they activated Division Agents. You're there to help these folks regain control over the city, so don't shoot the people in fatigues with green health bars over their heads. They're on your side."
thedivision,Missing Agents,You aren't the first wave of Division agents to arrive in the city. What happened to those that came before? Follow the clues to retrace their footsteps and uncover their fates.
thedivision,Named Elites,"When a bad egg is so bad that people know their name, or have maybe just made one up for them that everybody uses now, you know they're bad. Bring your A-game to take Elites and their crews down and you'll get some Better Than Your Average Loot."
thedivision,Perks,"The nice thing about a Perk is that once you unlock it by investing supplies in your Base of Operations, it's always there, helpin' you out while you try to save the day. They'll increase your inventory size, boost your XP gain, and unlock new areas of your Base of Operations, just to name a few. Thanks, Perks!"
thedivision,Safe house,"Two of the sweetest words in The Division's vocabulary. A place to rest, restock, and pick up new missions. A place to buy, sell, and craft gear. A place to listen to Rick Valassi's latest pirate radio updates in peace. It's neat to see what kind of spaces get made into a safe havens, like gymnasiums, bars, and... video game development studios?"
thedivision,Skills,"Doing stuff besides just shooting guns in combat is important, and your two (2) skills give you a variety of ways to tip the battle in your favor. Throwing down an auto-turret to shoot bad guys and draw attention away from you is good. Popping a quick healing charge to restore health to you and your buddies is good. Busting out a big shield and walking straight at your foes while shooting them with your sidearm is risky! But also good. All the skills are good, so use 'em as often as you can and look for gear and mods that can increase the power of your skills and reduce their cooldowns so you can use 'em more often."
thedivision,SDH,"This is the organization that sent you in, the ""Break Glass in Case of Very Bad Emergency"" crew. You are part of the second wave of Agents sent in by this powerful and secretive group, and if you think every Division Agent sent into Manhattan played things by the book, you've got a lot to learn."
thedivision,Shade,"This is the organization that sent you in, the ""Break Glass in Case of Very Bad Emergency"" crew. You are part of the second wave of Agents sent in by this powerful and secretive group, and if you think every Division Agent sent into Manhattan played things by the book, you've got a lot to learn."
thedivision,Strategic Homeland Division,"This is the organization that sent you in, the ""Break Glass in Case of Very Bad Emergency"" crew. You are part of the second wave of Agents sent in by this powerful and secretive group, and if you think every Division Agent sent into Manhattan played things by the book, you've got a lot to learn."
thedivision,Talents,"While it is certainly possible that your Agent could Tap Dance While Singing ""Goodbye, My Coney Island Baby"", these talents are more along the lines of Combat Bonuses to Help You Stay Alive and Win Fights. Whether you like to pick off enemies from the safety of cover or aggressively press forward during firefights, there are talents to help you make it in this world. You're gonna be a star."
thedivision,Weak spots,"Target your enemies weak spots to jack 'em up good. Usually it's their heads. On the Cleaners, it's their red fuel tanks. Elite enemies and bossesoften have special weak spots, so try to identify them and then shoot your bullets into them."
thedivision,Weapons,"Guns. Two primary slots for the big ones, and one sidearm slot (with unlimited ammo!) for the small ones. Their color allows you to judge them at a glance; in order of increasing rarity, you‚Äôll find white (worn), green (standard), blue (specialized), purple (superior), gold (high-end), and red (exotic!). Rarer is usually better."
thedivision,XP,"Experience points will help you gain levels and you earn them from doing most things in The Division, from completing major Story Missions to pistol-whipping a Rioter in a parking lot. Once you hit the maximum level, XP will be funneled towards Field Proficiency levels that lead to sweet, sweet Caches."
thedivision,Caches,"These sealed boxes have loot inside them for you. Take the loot out, and it's yours! Gear, weapons, crafting materials, currencies... it's all good stuff. There are a lot of ways to earn caches, like completing Daily and Weekly Assignments, taking on Missions on harder difficulties, and gaining XP past level 30, just to name a few."
thedivision,Cypher Keys,"Required to open Encrypted Caches, Cypher Keys can be acquired whole or pieced together with Fragments. Find them in the world or buy them with Premium Credits purchased from the online store."
thedivision,Cypher Key Fragments,"Required to open Encrypted Caches, Cypher Keys can be acquired whole or pieced together with Fragments. Find them in the world or buy them with Premium Credits purchased from the online store."
thedivision,Dark Zone,"Some of the Division Agents that dropped into NYC went bad, but have you ever asked yourself, ""What if the Agent that went bad, was me?"" The Dark Zone is a sizable region smack dab in the middle of Manhattan where you can explore your darker side, or bring those who have gone bad to justice. Agents in the Dark Zone can go Rogue and take out other Agents, stealing their loot and potentially earning big rewards if they manage to escape the Manhunt that ensues. You can also play it by the book, hunting down roving bands of enemies and earning DZ Funds to purchase weapons and gear. Just be warned: Any gear or weapons you loot or purchase in the Dark Zone needs to be extracted by helicopter at one of the designated areas in order for you to use it. And extracting gear tends to draw a crowd..."
thedivision,Encrypted Caches,Find them at the Premium Vendor in The Terminal and crack ‚Äòem open with Cypher Keys. What‚Äôll you find inside? Cool cosmetic gear that‚Äôll show other Agents you mean business.
thedivision,Expansions,"There are three expansions to The Division that must be purchased separately in order to enjoy the unique challenges and reap the rich rewards bundled therein. They are Underground, Survival, and Last Stand."
thedivision,Extraction,"Any weapons or gear you acquire in the Dark Zone is contaminated, so you can't equip it immediately and you can't walk out with it. You need to have it extracted by a helicopter at one of the designated extraction areas. Summon a helicopter, however, and everyone nearby is gonna hear about it. People calling for extraction usually have loot, you see, and that is something that Rogue Agents and enemy factions may take an interest in. Be on guard!"
thedivision,Last Stand,"The biggest PvP brawls in The Division can be found in this expansion, where two teams of eight players fight to control strategic terminals across street-level and underground areas covering multiple city blocks. Captured terminals can activate crucial defenses, and currency earned by taking out enemy factions can be used to purchase valuable boosts. Coordinate with your team and read the battlefield to take the fight to where you need it most. It's a rollicking good time!"
thedivision,Loadouts,"This term refers broadly to the weapons, gear, skills, and talents you have equipped. You can save a bunch of loadouts in the Loadouts tab and switch between them as you see fit. This is really helpful for when you want to experiment with different stuff, and very handy once you start assembling on some fancy Gear Sets."
thedivision,Mods,"Sometimes you just need a little extra in life. Some extra Electronics to trigger a Weapon Talent. A little extra range for your Support Station. Mods are things you equip to certain gear items to get a little extra, and fun fact: mods can be used on different gear items in different Loadouts, so you can always be using your most effective ones."
thedivision,Premium Credits,"Buy these with real-world currency to spend in-game at the Premium Vendor on cosmetic items like outfits and emotes, as well as skins for your backpack and weapons."
thedivision,PvP,"Player vs. Player means other human players are gonna try to kill you. Player vs Environment means it's just the enemy factions who are out to get you. Some modes and areas are just PvE (the open world, Resistance, Underground), while others are just PvP (Skirmish, Last Stand). The Dark Zone is both PvE and PvP, and in Survival, you can choose PvE or PvP when you queue for a match."
thedivision,PvE,"Player vs. Player means other human players are gonna try to kill you. Player vs Environment means it's just the enemy factions who are out to get you. Some modes and areas are just PvE (the open world, Resistance, Underground), while others are just PvP (Skirmish, Last Stand). The Dark Zone is both PvE and PvP, and in Survival, you can choose PvE or PvP when you queue for a match."
thedivision,Resistance,"People from different walks of life coming together with a common goal can be heartwarming, unless those people are the enemy factions of The Division and their common goal is to kill you. In this PvE mode, you team up with up to three other players (a full squad is definitely recommended) to take on wave after wave of tougher and tougher foes from every enemy faction. Pay special attention to the objective of each round to maximize your rewards, and use the currency you earn to resupply, activate bonuses, or unlock chests with awesome loot. Find Resistance matches in the West Side Pier area."
thedivision,Rogue Agent,"One of the reasons the Dark Zone is so dark is because other players can just up and kill you. This makes them Rogue Agents; they get marked on the minimap for righteous Agents to hunt down and bring to justice. So why go Rogue? Well, if you're notorious enough and manage to reach a special terminal to call off the Manhunt, the rewards will be sweet. Looks like crime might pay after all?"
thedivision,Signature Skills,"The third skill slot is reserved for one of these beauties that come in three delectable flavors (corresponding to the Wings of your Base of Operations). From massive boosts to damage and fire rate to instant revival upon death, these bonuses can turn the tide of battle in your favor. Just beware the lengthy cooldown period."
thedivision,Skirmish,"A PvP mode in which two teams of four fight it out for supremacy in short, speedy skirmishes. Hence the name."
thedivision,Survival,"Every time you start a new match in the Survival expansion, you wake up alone with no armor and only a pistol to your name. You are sick and will die in one hour if you don't keep the infection at bay with medication. There's a winter storm and you will die from the cold if you don't keep your body temperature up and find warm clothing. Your mission is to scavenge weapons and gear, fight your way to the Dark Zone, find a virus sample, and extract before you die. Whether you're playing PvE or PvP, each playthrough is a new challenge that tests your Division skills in new ways. It's an absolute blast!"
thedivision,The Terminal,"Located in the basement of the Base of Operations, this is your access point to competitive game modes (Skirmish), special Vendors (Global Events, Special Blueprints, Special Equipment, and the Premium guy with the Encrypted Caches), and the three DLC expansions (Underground, Survival, and Last Stand). That's one busy basement!"
thedivision,Underground,"The labyrinthine, procedurally generated tunnels beneath New York City play host to intense PvE missions in this expansion. Set your difficulty, choose your operation, and descend to face the unknown. As you level up in Underground, you'll gain access to new difficulty modifiers, including some double-edged-sword bonuses that challenge you to adapt your tactics. The tougher the mission you take on, the bigger the rewards at the end, and you might even have the both-good-and-bad fortune to get hunted by a Hunter down there. It's a real gas!"
thedivision,Weapon talents,"While it is certainly possible that your weapon could Juggle Scarves While Reciting the Gettysburg Address, weapon talents are more along the lines of Special Boosts or Status Effects Your Weapon Can Activate to Kick More Ass. If you've got the right Firearms/Stamina/Electronics stats, talents could do anything from speeding up reload times to increasing headshot damage to accelerating skill cooldowns. With these babies in your corner, you're going straight to the top!"
thedivision,West Side Pier,"This area was recently opened up for exploration and plays to the Resistance game mode, as well as a new social space to hang out and buy stuff called Camp Clinton. Think of it like a miniature Base of Operations, only way less needy."
thedivision,Assignments,"Delivered on a Daily and Weekly basis, these tasks are a regular source of Caches for the assiduous Agent. Find them in the Mission Overview tab of your Map screen."
thedivision,Gear Score,"This number is a quick way to gauge how powerful your current Loadout is. Derived from the rating of your weapons and armor, your Gear Score is a handy reference that can help you take on the right enemies, target the right upgrades, and set a World Tier that suits your fancy. You're never too young to start investing in a good Gear Score."
thedivision,Gear Sets,"Gear generally follows the same quality rainbow of colors as weapons, with one important difference: the top tier color is green for Gear Sets (Don't worry, it's a different shade of green). Gear Sets are unique, named gear combos that can confer powerful Set bonuses when you equip a few from the same set. Slap on a few FireCrest pieces to drastically increase your fire turret range and damage. Suit up with some Reclaimer pieces to boost your healing skill, or take Banshee's Shadow pieces to make your Dark Zone activities more lucrative. A standalone green gear item isn't necessarily better than a gold gear item, but when you start stacking set bonuses, it‚Äôs a game changer. Take it even further and earn extra bonuses by collecting and equipping Classified Gear sets, and pretty soon even your own mother won‚Äôt recognize you."
thedivision,Global Events,"These modifiers descend on The Division for a limited time, shaking things up and giving you a chance to earn special rewards. One modifier might cause headshots to damage nearby enemies, while another might increase the damage you do if you and your teammates are close to each other. Adapt your tactics to suit the Event, and you'll be rewarded handsomely with GE Credits that you can use to buy caches of Classified Gear."
thedivision,Incursions,"Big, bad boss fights against some of the toughest opposition you'll find in The Division. You'll need a crew with complementary skills and a sound strategy if you hope to take these bad boys down. Watching a YouTube video probably wouldn't hurt, either."
thedivision,Legendary Difficulty,"Sounds hard. Bet the rewards are good, though."
thedivision,World Tiers,"World Tiers are The Division's way of ramping up the challenge for you as you continue to get better and better gear. Higher tiers mean tougher enemies and better rewards, so keep an eye on your Gear Score and move to a higher Tier when you're ready. Once you hit World Tier 5, you‚Äôre running with the big dogs, chasing an even higher gear score, and ready to earn some of the best loot in the game."
